# Sales Analysis


By analysis of 12 months of store sales data, I uncovered pivotal insights: from top-selling products and their success factors to customer segmentation and timing insights. Discovering the best-sellers highlighted customer preferences, while understanding success factors informed strategic decisions. Insights into peak sales periods guided marketing strategies, while customer segmentation facilitated tailored approaches. Prepared to adapt strategically, I aim to leverage predictive analytics for future trends, ultimately enhancing our understanding of customer behaviors and shaping future strategies.
